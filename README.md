## Database schema

- **users** — telegram_id (PK), balance, total_earned, streak_count, last_checkin_date, referred_by, binance_pay_id, is_banned
- **transactions** — immutable ledger; every balance change (ad_reward, task_reward, referral_commission, referral_bonus, checkin, withdrawal, admin_adjust) writes one row here, so the balance is always auditable/reconstructable
- **tasks** — admin-configurable custom tasks (title, url, reward, task_type)
- **user_tasks** — completion record per user/task (UNIQUE constraint prevents double-claiming)
- **withdrawals** — amount, method, payout_id, network, status (pending/approved/rejected)
- **ad_events** — one row per credited ad view; UNIQUE(reward_event) blocks double-crediting the same ad view, and it's queried for daily-limit + cooldown checks
- **referrals** — referrer_id → referred_id edges + running total_commission

Full DDL is in `backend/app/database.py`.

## Security notes

1. **initData validation** (`auth.py`): every request re-derives the HMAC using your bot token per Telegram's official algorithm and rejects stale (`auth_date` older than 24h) or tampered payloads. Nothing about the user is ever trusted from the frontend alone.
2. **Ad reward integrity**: `ad_events.reward_event` has a UNIQUE constraint, so the same Adsgram view can never be credited twice — whether reported by the client or Adsgram's server postback. A daily limit + cooldown (both configurable via env vars) throttle abuse.
3. **Withdrawal funds are reserved immediately**: the amount is deducted from `balance` the moment a withdrawal request is submitted (not on approval), so a user can't submit multiple withdrawals against the same balance while the first is pending. If an admin rejects it, the amount is refunded.
4. **Admin routes** are gated by a shared `X-Admin-Key` header (see `.env.example` → `ADMIN_API_KEY`). Fine for a small internal team; swap for real per-admin auth if you open this up to more people.

## Admin dashboard (`frontend/admin.html`)

A separate, key-gated control panel — same dark glassmorphism look as the user app — covering everything you can tune without redeploying:

| Tab | Controls |
|-----|----------|
| **Overview** | Total users, active today, total user balance, total paid out, pending withdrawals (count + amount), ads watched, referrals |
| **Withdrawals** | Filter by status, approve or reject pending requests (rejecting auto-refunds the user) |
| **Users** | Search by ID/username/name, ban or unban, manually adjust a user's balance (credit or debit, logged as an `admin_adjust` transaction) |
| **Tasks** | Create custom tasks, enable/disable, delete |
| **Settings** | Ads on/off + Adsgram block ID + reward/limit/cooldown, referral commission % + signup bonus, min withdrawal + amount tiers, daily check-in on/off + 7-day streak reward schedule, support username, maintenance mode + message |
| **Broadcast** | Send a text message to every non-banned user via the bot |

All of these read/write the new `settings` table (see `database.py` → `get_settings()` / `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`), which every user-facing endpoint now reads live — so changing "Reward per Ad" in the dashboard takes effect on the next ad watched, with zero redeploy. `config.py`'s env vars are only the first-boot seed values.

**Access it** at `https://<your-vercel-domain>/admin.html`, enter the `ADMIN_API_KEY` you set in Railway. The key is stored in the browser's `localStorage` after a successful login — treat that browser as trusted, or log out (top-right) when done. Update `API_BASE` at the top of `frontend/js/admin.js` the same way you did in `js/api.js`.

## Setup

### 1. Backend (Railway)

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env      # fill in BOT_TOKEN, ALLOWED_ORIGINS, ADSGRAM_*, etc.
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload   # local dev
```

Deploy to Railway:
1. Push this repo, create a new Railway project, point it at `backend/`.
2. Add all variables from `.env.example` under Railway → Variables.
3. Railway auto-detects `railway.json` / `Procfile` and runs `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`.
4. Add a **second** Railway service (same repo, same folder) with start command `python -m app.bot` to run the Telegram bot independently of the API — so a bot crash/restart never takes the withdrawal/ad endpoints down.
5. Attach a Railway **volume** mounted at the backend's working directory so `app_data.db` (SQLite) persists across deploys.

### 2. Frontend (Vercel)

```bash
cd frontend
# edit js/api.js  -> API_BASE = "https://<your-railway-backend>.up.railway.app"
# edit js/adsgram.js -> ADSGRAM_BLOCK_ID = "<your Adsgram block id>"
```
Deploy the `frontend/` folder as a static site on Vercel (no build step needed).

### 3. Telegram

1. Message @BotFather → `/newapp` → attach your Vercel URL as the Mini App.
2. In `backend/app/bot.py`, set `MINI_APP_URL` to `https://t.me/<bot_username>/<mini_app_short_name>`.
3. In Adsgram's dashboard, create a block for your bot and set the **Postback URL** to
   `https://<your-backend>.up.railway.app/api/ads/postback` if you want server-to-server verification (recommended) — otherwise the client-reported `/api/ads/claim` path (already wired into the frontend) works out of the box.

## Tuning the economy

All reward amounts, limits, and thresholds live in `backend/app/config.py` (env-overridable): `AD_REWARD_USDT`, `AD_DAILY_LIMIT`, `AD_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`, `REFERRAL_COMMISSION_PERCENT`, `REFERRAL_SIGNUP_BONUS`, `STREAK_REWARDS` (7-day escalating array), `MIN_WITHDRAWAL_USDT`, `WITHDRAWAL_TIERS`.
